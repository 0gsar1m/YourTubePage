In this work, you will see a YouTube-like home page design where I use my basic html and css knowledge.

# Welcome to my html-CSS project
### My aim in this basic level project was to create a concrete work with the basic HTML features and my CSS knowledge.

Here you can see my draft-page which it's running on my local host

After putting the basic html elements on my page, I realized the design with CSS. With CSS, I first designed my head-left, which is one of my head-left, head-center and head-right elements, and then I organized it into a flex structure.

Next step:

Afterwards, I set the head-center and head-right elements and put them into flex structures. Here I also made sure to keep my input and search-icon in my head-center element in a flex structure. Thus, I put it in a more organized structure. I gave the required gap and margin values. Finally, I added a hover with a value of .3s.

After completing the sidebar and header, we came to the video-list section, which is the last element of "this draft". Here, I opened an img element to include the subtitle and channel name, and then copied and pasted it into the list structure. Then I added a grid feature to this structure to get a more aesthetic and organized list.

Finally, I gave my header and sidebar elements a background, made them fixed and set the z-index so that they stay on the page during scrolling. This completes our draft.
